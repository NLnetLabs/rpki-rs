//! All things RPKI.
//!
//! The _Resource Public Key Infrastructure_ (RPKI) is an application of
//! PKI to Internet routing security. It allows owners of IP address prefixes
//! and AS numbers to publish cryptographically signed information about
//! these resources. In particular, RPKI is currently used for route origin
//! validation where these statements list the AS numbers that are allowed
//! to originate routes for prefixes.
//!
//! This crate will eventually implement all functionality necessary to both
//! produce and validate RPKI data. It currently implements everything
//! necessary for validation and is slowly gaining the ability to produce
//! objects as well.
//!
//! Documentation for the items in this crate is currently somewhat sparse.
//! This will be rectified in upcoming releases.

// We have seemingly redundant closures (i.e., closures where just providing
// a function would also work) that cannot be removed due to lifetime issues.
